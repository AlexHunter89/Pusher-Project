    "# Pusher Space Optimization Script\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is focused on optimizing the use of shelf space in retail environments, particularly where products are displayed using pusher fixtures. Pusher fixtures are designed to hold products in place on a shelf by latching onto a railing system. However, due to the fixed notches on the railing, pushers can only be moved in 0.5 cm increments, with a minimum spacing of 4.5 cm between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "This script converts product widths provided in inches to centimeters, adjusts them to the nearest fit based on the pusher spacing constraints, and calculates the space lost due to these constraints. The goal is to minimize wasted space on the shelf and ensure that products fit within the allotted space as efficiently as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing, as usual, will be to import the libraries that are going to be used in our script."
